Provides the turnout state over loconet for Digitrax systems. I have lots of Cobalt point control motors, and JMRI simply does not know how to know the state. If you ask them to change, it catches up, but anything automated won't be tracked. The purpose here is twofold.

* Learn about Loconet and continue to grow my hobby hardware skills.
* Solve the issue where at startup JMRI may have the wrong states.

This is based on RPi 2040's using the LocoNet2 library. Included in the repo is my Arduino ino file and the KiCad artifacts.
